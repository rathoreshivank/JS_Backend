# Backend Learning Project  

This repository contains my learning progress in backend development using Node.js, Express, and MongoDB. The focus is on understanding core backend concepts such as:  

- User authentication (JWT, bcrypt, session handling)  
- API development with Express.js  
- Middleware functions and error handling  
- File uploads with Multer and Cloudinary  
- Database modeling with Mongoose  
- Pagination using `mongoose-aggregate-paginate-v2`  
- Structuring backend applications (routes, controllers, services)  

This is a work in progress as I continue to explore and implement these backend concepts.
